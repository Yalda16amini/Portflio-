                <h2>About me</h2>
                <p>
                    I am Yalda, a multidisciplinary artist from Afghanistan with a deep-rooted passion for visual
                    storytelling and cultural expression through fine arts. My artistic journey spans several mediums
                    including miniature painting, charcoal drawing, oil painting, watercolor, ink techniques, and mixed
                    media.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have participated in several national and international art exhibitions. Most notably, I was
                    honored
                    with top recognition at an international exhibition in Germany, where my artwork was showcased
                    across
                    multiple cities and received both first and seventh place distinctions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This portfolio is a curated collection of my artistic endeavors ‚Äî serving as a space to present my
                    skills, projects, and creative vision. Whether for exhibition, collaboration, or commissioned work,
                    I
                    welcome opportunities to connect with individuals and institutions who value the power of art in
                    cultural dialogue and transformation.

    <h2>Portfolio</h2>
    <h1>My Artwork Collection</h1>
    <p>This collection represents the essence of my artistic journey ‚Äî 
    a visual expression of emotions, memories, and cultural identity. Through a range of mediums including miniature painting,

     reflecting universal themes such as beauty, resilience, and the soul of tradition.
     Every artwork in this gallery is created with passion, precision, and purpose. It is my hope that these
